                        <h5>DESIGN A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h5>
                        <p>Workplace culture doesn't start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn't end with 
                            neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It's the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that
                             enable good work to get done, or it's what stifles a workforcce. For design t be most effective and for
                              designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces dedsign and allows it to succeed.</p>
                          <p>In Aaron's session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large
                               and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don't and more 
                               importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace's culture. Once you've worked within a culture of
                                design it's almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>

                      <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written narrative and 
                        effective storttelling technique. It's the filmmaker's job to put this together. To do so they've developeded processes,
                         tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elementd 
                         that together comprise a well-told story.</p>
                        <p>With this workshop, we'll revist the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technique aspects used in film to communucate. We'll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We'll consider why they're used and how we might look to them for inspiration.
